                With descriptors for 330949 monodentate organophosphorus(III)
                ligands at two levels of theory as well as property estimation
                powered by machine learning, we hope experimentalists,
                theoreticians, and data scientists will find utility in this library
                when designing new ligands for catalysis. This descriptor set
                accounts for conformational flexibility and was created by the authors of "Mapping the Property
                Space of Monodentate Organophosphorus Ligands for Catalysis",
                preprint on ChemRxiv (doi: 10.26434/chemrxiv.12996665).
